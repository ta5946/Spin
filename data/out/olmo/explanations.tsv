167	237	612	the ABC Irritability subtest score	treatment-related side effects	0	9.736200734522527e-10	0	The reported outcome, treatment-related side effects, is a secondary outcome, which means it is an observed variable that is studied alongside the primary outcome, but it is not the primary focus. The primary outcome, ABC Irritability subtest score, is the specific measure of the primary subject of interest, which is the effect of the intervention on irritability. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome.
421	655	105	attitudes, knowledge and skills in EBM	knowledge	0	0.008577484637498856	0	The reported outcome is focused on knowledge related to EBM, while the defined primary outcome was attitudes, knowledge, and skills in EBM. The two are not directly comparable or measuring the same concept.

Primary outcomes are the observed variables of the study, and they should be reported in the results section, as specified in the introduction. Therefore, the reported outcome, economic cost, does not match the defined primary outcome of educational achievement and anaemia.
248	1619	951	sucrose/pacifier effect on pain reduction	crying time	0	0.00247262348420918	0	The reported outcome, crying time, is a secondary outcome, which means it is an observed variable that is analyzed alongside the primary outcome, but it is not the primary focus of the study. The primary outcome, sucrose/pacifier effect on pain reduction, is the main variable of interest that is intended to be measured and reported in the study. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome.
407	650	170	trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) at 24 h post-dose after 14 days	24-h bronchodilation	0	1.473898100812221e-05	0	The reported outcome, 24-h bronchodilation, is not the primary outcome defined at the start of the trial. The primary outcome is trough FEV1 at 24 h post-dose after 14 days, which is a measure of forced expiratory volume in one second after a 14-day treatment period. The reported outcome is a measure of bronchodilation, which is a shorter-term effect that may or may not be related to the primary outcome.

Therefore, the reported outcome matches the defined primary outcome.
391	632	216	Physical Function	function	1	1.0	1	"The reported outcome ""function"" is a broad and inclusive term that encompasses the primary outcome ""Physical Function"" that was defined at the start of the trial. Both the primary outcome and the reported outcome include the measurement of an individual's physical ability or functioning. Therefore, the reported outcome matches the defined primary outcome."
473	1601	395	costs per quality adjusted life years (cost/QALY)	tube dependency	0	5.263339986072424e-09	0	The reported outcome, tube dependency, is a secondary outcome, which means it is not the primary outcome defined at the start of the trial. The primary outcome was costs per QALY, which is a primary outcome. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome.
69	396	800	force platform variables PVF and impulse, the validated HCPI and the use of rescue NSAIDs	NSAID use	0	2.2159490242756874e-08	0	The reported outcome, NSAID use, is not a primary outcome but rather a secondary outcome or an additional result of the trial. The primary outcome, as defined, is force platform variables, HCPI validation, and rescue NSAID use.

The primary outcome is health-related quality of life, which is an overall measure of a person's well-being in the context of their health status. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome.
117	170	133	The frequency, duration and severity of exacerbations	frequency	0	2.902311962316162e-06	0	The reported outcome, frequency, is a component of the primary outcome, which is the frequency, duration, and severity of exacerbations. The reported outcome does not include all components of the primary outcome or provide the necessary details. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome.
45	77	797	VC	IPF	0	1.3307808188756098e-09	0	The reported outcome, IPF (mean improved forced vital capacity), is not the defined primary outcome, VC (mean forced vital capacity). The primary outcome determines the focus and focus of the trial, and the reported outcome should align with that focus.
96	1122	88	days alive and off assisted breathing	forced vital capacity (FVC	0	2.335593052293916e-09	0	"The primary outcome is defined as ""days alive and off assisted breathing,"" while the reported outcome is ""forced vital capacity (FVC)."" FVC is a measure of lung capacity, but it is not a direct measure of survival or the primary outcome of interest in this trial. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome."
596	913	246	Apgar scores less than 8	instrumental birth	0	1.9362746961348876e-09	0	The reported outcome, instrumental birth, is not a primary outcome but rather a secondary outcome or an intervention being evaluated as part of the study. The primary outcome, Apgar scores less than 8, is a continuous outcome measured at a specific time point (5 minutes after birth) and is intended to assess the newborn's overall health based on Apgar scores. Therefore, the reported outcome does not match the defined primary outcome.

The primary outcome is the mean levels of HbA1c, cholesterol, and BP, as well as the numbers of patients with recorded foot inspections in the previous calendar month. This primary outcome is not being reported in the outcome being examined."

Therefore, the reported outcome is a component of the primary outcome."
451	1512	1052	more frequently interrupted MARS sessions without anticoagulation	patency of the extracorporeal circuit	0	2.998960857425459e-09	0	The reported outcome is focused on the patency of the extracorporeal circuit, which is a secondary outcome or a measure of the effect of the intervention, not the primary outcome of more frequently interrupted MARS sessions without anticoagulation. The primary outcome is the observed variable of the study, which is the success of the MARS intervention in achieving the desired outcome of interruptions without anticoagulation.
402	646	208	the EPDS (a 10-item scale developed for use in the postnatal period, in which a score ≥ 13 identifies probable depression 33	MCS	0	1.7257828943684217e-08	0	The reported outcome is the Mean Composite Score (MCS) of the Short Form (SF)-36 health survey, while the primary outcome is the Epdeen-Pavlik Depressive Scale (EPDS) score of 13 or more, indicating probable depression. The EPDS is a specific and sensitive tool for screening and detecting postnatal depression, while the SF-36 is a generic, broad-based, and multi-attribute health survey. The two measures are not interchangeable, and the primary outcome should not be replaced by a secondary outcome in the results section.

The primary outcome is the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI.
